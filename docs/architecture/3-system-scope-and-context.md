## 3 System scope and context

### Business Context
The following image shows the ICH and the context where operates. The figure shows how the number of operations a use case needs to perfom through the ICH is reduced in comparison to use cases accessing directly data space components or only using the SDK libraries.
Changes in any of the components only affect libraries. This implies that use cases using the ICH will not be affected by those changes while use cases accessing directly will need to be updated.
