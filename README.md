# Industry Core Hub

## Overview

The Industry Core Hub is an plug-and-play application that allows use cases to build their logic without needing to undertand in detail how the basic dataspace components (EDC, Digital Twin Registry, Submodel Server) work.

This application is built taking into consideration the best practices and standards of Catena-X Industry Core and Dataspace experts. It aims to create a real speedway for use cases. Allowing applications to be developed in less than two weeks.

## Objectives

- reduce the complexity of the Eclipse Tractus-X Adoption
- create an stable, scalable and easy to use backend SDK for the use case applications.
- enable the 1.000 users goal of Catena-X for 2025.
